About
-----
Asuswrt-Merlin is an enhanced version of Asuswrt, the firmware used by Asus's modern routers.

The goal of this project is to fix issues and bring some minor functionality adjustments to the 
original Asus firmware.  While some features do get added, this is not the main focus of this project.  
It is not meant to replace existing projects such as Tomato or DD-WRT, but rather to offer an alternative 
for people who prefer the original firmware featureset.

Please consult the Wiki for an up-to-date list of supported models:
